## Environment variables used for testing
REPLICA_ID={{.Task.Slot}}

## Directories
# shared dir on the container fs
EXP_SHARED_DIR=/exp
# the with all the repos
EXP_REPOS_DIR=${EXP_SHARED_DIR}/repos
# diretory for bootstraps to dump their addresses
EXP_BOOT_DIR=${EXP_SHARED_DIR}/boot
# directory for logs (after the experiments)
EXP_LOG_DIR=${EXP_SHARED_DIR}/logs

## Files
# the file with all the cids (one per line)
EXP_CIDS_FILE=${EXP_SHARED_DIR}/cids.txt
# the file the 'worker' nodes will read to get the bootstrap nodes addresses
EXP_BOOT_FILE=${EXP_BOOT_DIR}/bootstrap-nodes.json

## numbers
# the total number of nodes (bootstraps + worker) in the system
EXP_TOTAL_NODES=606
# the number of cids each node will publish
EXP_CIDS_PER_NODE=20
# the duration of the experiment from the START_TIME (this is indepentent of the grace period and connecting period)
EXP_DURATION=30m
# the time nodes will wait between consecutives resolves
EXP_RESOLVE_WAIT_TIME=10s
# the time nodes will wait between consecutives publishes
EXP_PUSBLISH_WAIT_TIME=0s
# period after start time within which 'worker' nodes will connect to the bootstraps
EXP_GRACE_PERIOD=5m
# time to wait for after grace period to start publishing (allow nodes to connect to each other)
EXP_CONNECTING_PERIOD=1m
# period of time (in seconds) after which the experiment will be launched (defines EXP_START_TIME)
EXP_LAUNCH_PERIOD=5m
# extra time to wait before killing the containers
EXP_EXTRA_TIME=5m 
# time after which the experiment will start on every node. This is defined 
# dynamically by the run.sh script by add EXP_LAUNCH_PERIOD to the current time.
# EXP_START_TIME=

## Variables specify for upgradable experiments (TODO: put this in its own file later)
# number of normal bootstraps nodes (for upgradable experment)
EXP_NORMAL_BOOT_NODES=3
# number of secure bootstraps nodes (for upgradable experment)
EXP_SECURE_BOOT_NODES=3
# number of 'worker' normal nodes
EXP_NORMAL_NODES=300
# number of 'worker' secure nodes
EXP_SECURE_NODES=300

## Variables specific for the default experiment (TODO: find a better solution than this)
EXP_TOTAL_WORKER_NODES=600
# number of bootstraps nodes
EXP_TOTAL_BOOT_NODES=6

## subnet for the network (it has to start with 192 - tecnical problems to be fixed later)
EXP_NETWORK_SUBNET=192.169.0.0/16
